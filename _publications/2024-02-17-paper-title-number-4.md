The rapid increase in syphilis cases in Japan in recent years necessitates a thorough investigation into the factors driving its spread. While previous studies have explored various contributors, the role of dating applications remains relatively underexamined. This study investigates the association between dating application usage and the spread of syphilis in Japan. Using prefecture-level data from 2016 to 2022, I employ instrumental variable methods to analyze the relationship between dating application usage and syphilis infections. Google Trends data on searches for popular dating applications serve as a proxy for their popularity, while the instrumental variable approach enhances the robustness of the findings. The analysis reveals a positive association between dating application usage and the spread of syphilis, suggesting that increased usage of these platforms correlates with higher infection rates. Potential mechanisms include the facilitation of prostitution and an increased likelihood of unprotected sexual encounters. These findings underscore the significant role that dating applications may play in the spread of syphilis in Japan, highlighting the importance of targeted public health interventions to mitigate the spread of sexually transmitted infections.
