As the COVID-19 pandemic ushered Japan into a new era of widespread remote work and online education, it reduced unnecessary travel and increased leisure time. However, these changes had significant drawbacks, such as significantly reducing social connections and deteriorating mental health. This study examined changes in self-injury patterns in Japan during the state of emergency associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, a turning point for the broad-scale adoption of remote work and online education in Japan. This study used high-frequency data to identify self-injury incidents with precision down to the second and analyzed the data using a difference-in-differences method. The results revealed a complex response to the changes, with significant increases in self-injury incidents during non-working hours, particularly among women. These findings underscore the importance of targeted mental health interventions tailored to periods of elevated risk and demographic-specific vulnerabilities to mitigate the mental health repercussions of pandemic-induced lifestyle shifts.
