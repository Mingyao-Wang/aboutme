I am Mingyao Wang, currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Economics at Hitotsubashi University. My research primarily focuses on Environmental and Health Economics, particularly examining how environmental factors influence population health outcomes. Specializing in empirical analyses, I explore the intersection between environmental challenges and public health, aiming to provide evidence-based insights into how environmental issues affect population health. By integrating methodologies from Development Economics, Health Economics, and Environmental Economics, I strive to address these critical questions effectively and contribute to meaningful policy discussions.

For data analysis
======
I primarily use R for data cleaning and analysis, but I'm also proficient in Stata and Python. I have extensive experience in cleaning and analyzing high-quality datasets, including Japanese ambulance dispatch data and JMDC medical claims data. I'm skilled at handling large-scale datasets efficiently and accurately, ensuring robust and insightful analytical outcomes.


Teaching experience
======
I have substantial experience teaching and mentoring students, specifically in economics and quantitative analysis. My teaching experience primarily involves tutoring students preparing for undergraduate and graduate-level admissions to prestigious institutions in Japan. I have guided students who successfully gained admission to top-tier universities such as the University of Tokyo, Hitotsubashi University, Kyoto University, Osaka University, Tohoku University, among others.
